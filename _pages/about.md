Welcome to my website. I'm a first-year Ph.D. student of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Merced [PANS LAB](https://www.pans-lab.com/pans-lab), advised
by Prof. Shijia Pan. I obtained my B.S. degree and M.A. degree in Statistics from Nanjing University and Columbia University in 2017 and 2021, respectively.

In daily life, I love singing songs and playing the guitar. Please visit my [channel](https://space.bilibili.com/18942867?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0) if you are interested.
