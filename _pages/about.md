Welcome to my website. I'm a second-year master student of ELectrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Merced, advised by Professor [Meng Tang](http://mengtang.org/). Before that, I was briefly enrolled as a Ph.D student at UC Merced(2023Aug-2024Nov), advised by Professor [Shijia Pan](https://www.panslab.com/news). I obtained my B.S. degree and M.A. degree in Statistics from Nanjing University and Columbia University in 2021 and 2022, respectively. My research interests include deep learning, computer vision, and vision-language model.
For my detailed research projects, please refer to my [CV](http:ajay0422.github.io/assets/CV_Shangjie.pdf).  
Here are some [notes](https://ajay0422.github.io/posts/) I took through learning generative model if you're interested.

## IOT Classification Challenge: Activity Detection

Understanding human activities is an essential part in building a smart IOT environment. This project aims to use vision-based 
methods to classify human activities, different interactions with a fridge, in an IOT scenario. We use detectron2 to extract 
a skeleton representation of human gestures, which is simplified to the coordinates of 17 keypoints within a frame. The skeleton 
data extracted from a video is a time series. So we use the Transformer-based deep learning method to model the temporal information.
