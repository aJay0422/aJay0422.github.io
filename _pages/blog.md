{% include base_path %}

Here are some notes I took during learning.

- [Blog 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/blogs/blog1.md)
- [Blog 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/blogs/blog2.md)

<!-- {% assign post = site.blogs | where: "path", "blog1.md" %}
{% include archive-single.html %}

{% assign post = site.blogs | where: "path", "blog2.md" %}
{% include archive-single.html %} -->
